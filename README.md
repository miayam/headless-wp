# Miayam CMS

A modest CMS to manage [miayam.io](https://miayam.io) built with WordPress.

What kind of CMS should I use to serve my [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) sites?

- A headless CMS that can spew contents in JSON format
- Packaged as a Docker image so I can move it around from one free cloud service to another 
- Easy to use
- If I got any issues, I can solve it by copy-pasting error message on Google search bar

 WordPress just meets all criteria.
