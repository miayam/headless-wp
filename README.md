# Miayam Headless CMS

A Wordpress backend for [miayam.io](https://miayam.io) that serves its data via REST API.

This modest CMS is deployed on EC2 Free Tier instance until it's expired (1 year), and then it will be moved to free GCS instance for another 90 days, and then it will be moved to Digital Ocean ($5 a month), the cheapest of them all.

The maintainer of this repo is very poor ðŸ˜­.
